This is my submission for the web team selection round of the Branding and Relations Cell, IIT Kharagpur. 

This website only works well on PC screens. I tried to make it responsive but the layouts turned into a nightmare so decided against itgiven the time constraint.
I am pretty new to frontend web dev so this is the best I could do for now.

The following are the resources that were used to make the website:
- tutorials provided
- https://www.w3schools.com/
- testimonial slider - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJY8GWmoMfo
- Pinterest - for several of the images used and also landing page layouts used as inspiration
